ABOUT THEME
=========== 
WP Fan Zone was designed orginally with sports fans and bloggers in mind, but it could easily be used for any type of blog or magazine style site that wants to feature images and content. It is fully responsive, comes with two main menus, and widget areas for all page types. It also has customization options for social media links, color scheme and author bios, plus a simple banner widget for putting ads in the header.

This theme is compatible with Wordpress Version 3.4 and above and it supports the new theme customization API (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API).

All the image graphics and icons bundled with this theme are created by the author and licensed under the GPL.

Supported browsers: Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari and IE9+ (Some css3 styles like shadows, rounder corners and 2D transform are not supported by IE8 and below).
